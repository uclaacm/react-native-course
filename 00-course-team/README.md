# Course Team

We're a group of UCLA students (in an organization called [ACM Teach LA](https://teachla.uclaacm.com)) who love teaching people about just how _awesome_ computer science is! Here's a bit about each of us:

## Lead Instructor: Matt

Hi there! I'm Matt, a 2nd year Computer Science and Engineering Major at UCLA, and I'm pumped to help lead the React Native course this year!

React-Native was actually my first introduction to web and app development and I sorely wish that I started learning it earlier. I've used these tools & technologies that we're covering this year: (HTML,CSS JS, React, React-Native, Github) on cool projects/work in the past and I truly believe that this class can help us make some really cool things in the future!

Feel free to contact me with any questions or about anything in web/app development in general: [matthewcn56@gmail.com](mailto:matthewcn56@gmail.com)

# Instructor: Evan

Hi, I'm Evan, a second year Computer Science student at UCLA.

I remember taking AP CSP in high school and the class actually sparked my interest in pursuing CS in college. I'm passionate about web development and look forward to working with you all in this class!

If you have any question or concerns, feel free to reach out at [evanhe27@gmail.com](mailto:evanhe27@gmail.com)

## 2021 Lead Instructor: Chase

Hi, my name is Chase, I'm a 2nd year Computer Science student at UCLA.

Super excited to teach this class, I actually never got the opportunity to take a CS class until I got college so I'm super happy that you guys are getting some early exposure to some super interesting and relevant technologies that I use almost every day.

First and foremost I'm here to support you, so if you have any questions or concerns, don't hesistate to reach out. [chasekap@gmail.com](mailto:chasekap@gmail.com)

## 2021 Teach LA President: Matt

Hey there, my name is Matt! I'm a 3rd-year Computer Science & Math-Economics double major at UCLA, and I'm particularly passionate about how we can use computers to empower people!

This class has been something that I've been working on for the past year, and I'm super super excited to bring this to all of you! The technologies that underpin this class - HTML, CSS, JS, React, React Native, GitHub - are things that I've worked with for years as a software developer and a student, and I want to share these with you.

I've done web development (and other CS things) at startups, medium-sized companies, and huge ones (Amazon!) - if you have any questions about web development, computer science, or really anything, I'd be glad to talk about it! Say hi in the class, or shoot me an email at [matt@matthewwang.me](mailto:matt@matthewwang.me)!

## 2021 Instructor: Evan

Hey all! I'm a 2nd year student at UCLA currently studying Computer Science.

I love web development and think it's one of the most accessible forms of technology. Super stoked that you all get to learn about web and mobile development in high school, something my school district didn't offer. I'm also passionate about making tech hiring more equitable and efficient, and think getting an early introduction to the tools and concepts that this class covers is extremely important.

Hope to meet you all virtually in class. Please don't hesistate to reach out to me at [evanzhong@ucla.edu](mailto:evanzhong@ucla.edu) if you have any questions, feedback, or just want to talk.

## 2021 Instructor: Lisha

Hi, I'm Lisha! I'm a 3rd year at UCLA studying Computer Science.

I actually started my journey with CS by taking AP CSP in my senior year of high school, which is what convinced me to pursue CS in college! So I'm super excited to join you guys and teach you some skills that will help you take what you learn in this class to another level.

If you have questions about anything at all or just want to say hi, please feel free to email me at [lisha4mohan@yahoo.com](mailto:lisha4mohan@yahoo.com)!

## 2021 Instructor: Param

Hey everyone, I'm Param! I'm a 3rd-year Computer Science major at UCLA from India!

I'm super excited to teach this class, this is the first time ever I am teaching a high school class! I actually never wrote a line of code before coming to college so I'm particularly interested in seeing you all get early exposure to CS.

Hope to e-meet you all. I've done web development at a startup and clubs on campus so if you have any questions at all, don't hesitate to reach out to me at [paramshah09@gmail.com](mailto:paramshah09@gmail.com)!
