### Is this free to use?

Yup, absolutely!

If you do, we'd love to know how you used it and what we can do better - send us an email at [acmteachla@gmail.com](mailto:acmteachla@gmail.com)!

### What will I learn?

See the [welcome and overview lesson](https://github.com/uclaacm/react-native-course-20-21/tree/master/01-welcome-and-overview) or our course packet (coming soon!) for more information.

### Who can take this course?

Anybody is welcome to look through our notes and other course material! We developed these notes specifically for an AP CSP class at North Hollywood High School, for students with **little to no previous programming experience**. However, we taught this in conjunction with a class on Javascript basics, which gave us the leeway to skip over some JS fundamentals.

### Who's teaching this course?

We're a group of UCLA students (in an organization called [ACM Teach LA](https://teachla.uclaacm.com)) who love teaching people about just how *awesome* computer science is! See more [on our team note](https://github.com/uclaacm/react-native-course-20-21/tree/master/00-course-team) or [learn more about ACM Teach LA](https://teachla.uclaacm.com).

### Are there video recordings?

Unfortunately, due to LAUSD policies we are unable to record live offerings of our course. However, if you have any questions, we encourage you reach out to us (either [on GitHub](https://github.com/uclaacm/react-native-course-20-21/issues) or via email at [acmteachla@gmail.com](mailto:acmteachla@gmail.com)).
