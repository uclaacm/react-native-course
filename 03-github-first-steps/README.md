## What is GitHub? Why are we using it?

## Creating a GitHub Account
To create a github account you'll need an email address you can log in to, a secure password you'll remember and a creative username!

Once you've created an account select the options that best describe you in the welcome flow

## Creating a GitHub Repository
We now need to create a *Repository*. Think of a repository as analogous to a Google Drive folder, but with the added benefit of version control like we said before. Put simply, github will track the history of your files, which includes information about who updated which files at what time, and what content they added or deleted.

Let's make a repository. Click on the `Create a repository` button on the left-hand side

This part is important: name your new repository `YOUR_USER_NAME.github.io`
This special name signals to github that you plan to use this repository to host your account's github pages, which we'll talk about later.

We now have to fiddle around with the settings a bit to enable github pages.
Navigate to the settings tab from your homepage:

Find the section titled: `Github Pages`. In the dropdown menu in that section, select the `main` option
![Switch to the main branch](images/settings-2.png)

Wait a few minutes then navigate to `https://YOUR_USER_NAME.github.io`. (For example, mine would be: https://git-gud-at-github.github.io/index.html)
You'll be able to see your own webpage live on the internet! Any computer can navigate to your specific url and find your website.
